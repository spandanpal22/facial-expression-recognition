# facial-expression-recognition

Recognizes 7 types of facial expressions - Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprise.

I have already trained the model and provided the .h5 file and created a Flask app to use that trained model to detect facial expressions. 
In the videos folder I have given two videos, you can use your own as well by making one change in the camera.py file in the VideoCapture() function, to test it.

To run the project type in the command prompt/terminal-</br>
  python main.py
